Ever since the great war supply lines have been thin, but things are starting to get back to normal. Every now and then the bombs get dropped and we need to start from scratch, but hey thats no cost if we can still live the highlife most of the time.\\\n\\\nGet yourself a clunker from the junkyard and get her hauling goods if you can. Once you scratch up enough dough you can get a fancy autoNomic truck that will drive itself, but there is not better feeling than being on the road in your own truck.\\\n\\\nIf you find yourself weilding a sizeable truck army and just want to chat there is always the H.U.B at the center of our little world. It might not be much but its never a bad time, and you can always meet someone new. BTW the C.B Radio you are equiped with is only good for 100 miles so keep that in mind if you lose someone while you're talking.\\\n\\\nwelcome to the trucking world honey\\\n\\\n**SIGNED**\\\nBig Bobby Jo\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":1011}]"
