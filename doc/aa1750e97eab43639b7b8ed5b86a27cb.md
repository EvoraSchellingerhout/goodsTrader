- account
	- Stores
		- Username
		- unique login token
		- cash
		- Transports
	-url/account/\<username\>
		- GET
			- returns user information with token passed
		- POST

- Nodes
	- Idea
		- Nodes are one of 3 types
			- Producer
				- Creates goods at a set \<rate\> 
			- Refiner
				- Turns goods into refined goods at \<rate\> for \<fee\>
			- Consumer
				- Consumes goods at \<rate|> with supply and demand 							reaction
		- Nodes are dispersed randomly on a (radius, angle) circle
			- With all angles and radiuses being integers
			- one node (codename: H.U.B) at (0,0)
				- H.U.B is a NULL node and only serves as a starting point
				- All Players start here
				- No Production, refinement, or consumption
	- Future Ideas
		- Fuel
			- Transports require fuel to operate
			- all nodes will sell fuel for varying prices
			- OPTIONAL: Fuel must be produced and delivered
		- Serving as the main fuel station (cheapest but in conviennt)
		- local chat with H.U.B being the main social hub
			- Kinda like CB Radio
		- "Fog of War"
			- No node can be seen outside of 100 units of a truck
			- Exception being the H.U.B
				- But this will be balanced with the popularity
					- Theoretically
		- Node Size
			- As nodes get used their cash (or population) stacks up
			- As nodes grow their rate and max inventory increase
			- Nodes can shrink if not used
			- OPTIONAL: CRITICAL POINT
				- Implemented after fuel
				- if a node falls below a certain size
					- critSize
				- the node falls apart and is lost for the remander of the reset
